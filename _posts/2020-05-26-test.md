There is a list of people containing strings representing the names of some people. Write a nested loop that prints out all possible pairs of these people that can make up a group of two. So for example, your loop should print out:

Hank, Bobby
Hank, Peggy
Hank, Luanne
Bobby, Peggy
Bobby, Luanne
Peggy, Luanne

This question was answered in python.
### Code, with syntax highlighting

Code blocks use the [peppermint][2] theme.

{% highlight ruby %}
people = ["Hank", "Bobby", "Peggy", "Luanne"]

for i in range(len(people)):

  for j in range(i + 1, len(people)):

    print(people[i], people[j])
{% endhighlight %}

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<title>Title</title>

<style>body {width: 500px;}</style>

<script type="application/javascript">
  function $init() {return true;}
</script>

<body>
  <p checked class="title" id='title'>Title</p>
  <!-- here goes the rest of the page -->
</body>
```

# Headings!

They're responsive, and well-proportioned (in `padding`, `line-height`, `margin`, and `font-size`).

##### They draw the perfect amount of attention

This allows your content to have the proper informational and contextual hierarchy. Yay.

### There are lists, too

  * Apples
  * Oranges
  * Potatoes
  * Milk

  1. Mow the lawn
  2. Feed the dog
  3. Dance

### Images look great, too

### Stylish blockquotes included

You can use the markdown quote syntax, `>` for simple quotes.

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse quis porta mauris.

### LaTeX support

The default math delimiters are \$\$. Hence `$$ E = m \cdot c^2 $$` yields $$ E = m \cdot c^2 $$

And here's something more fancy:

$$ \zeta(s) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)} \int \limits_0^\infty x^{s-1} \sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-nx} \mathrm{d}x = \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)} \int \limits_0^\infty \frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x - 1} \mathrm{d}x $$


### There's more being added all the time

or add, features.

Happy writing.

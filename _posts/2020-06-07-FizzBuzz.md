Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n.

But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.

Attempt this question [here][1]

<ins>Example:</ins>
{% highlight ruby %}
n = 15,

Return:
[
    "1",
    "2",
    "Fizz",
    "4",
    "Buzz",
    "Fizz",
    "7",
    "8",
    "Fizz",
    "Buzz",
    "11",
    "Fizz",
    "13",
    "14",
    "FizzBuzz"
]

{% endhighlight %}

<ins>Solution:</ins>
{% highlight ruby %}
class Solution:
    def fizzBuzz(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        answer = []

        for i in range( 1, n+ 1):
            if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
                answer.append("FizzBuzz")

            elif i % 3 == 0:
                answer.append("Fizz")
            elif i % 5 == 0:
                answer.append("Buzz")
            else:
                answer.append(str(i))
        return answer
{% endhighlight %}

# Code Explanation:
Classic FizzBuzz. We first check if the number is divisible by both 5 and 3 using the modulus operator and checking if the remainder is 0. If doesn't pass the first if statement we check if it is divisible by just 3 and then by just 5 before simply just appending the number to the answer string.
